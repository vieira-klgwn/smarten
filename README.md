This is a leak detection system that is used to track water flow rate and also track leakages

It uses next for frontend, and recharts for making charts.

For us to get the data you are seeing, we didn't have the real data from the server because we have not set the hardware yet. Instead we were using mock data using Math.random in java script and send that data to websocket so it can be used by the client in real time.

To run the project, to the backend-mock-server folder and run node server.js 
After go to the frontend project and run "npm run dev"

On localhost:3000, this app will be running there.# smarten
